**Abstract**
The Brownlow Medal is the AFLâ€™s highest individual honour award. After each game the adjudicating
umpire would award 3 votes, 2 votes and 1 vote to the top three performing players in their opinion,
and the highest polling player of the whole season would be declared winner.
As the performance of AFL players are generally considered well represented by game statistics, the
idea of training a Predictor with the goal of predicting the winner of the Brownlow Medal based on
the data of all games that season came into existence.
There were four motivations for this project:
1. As an AFL enthusiast, the author hoped to train a Predictor which could to the best degree predict the Brownlow Medallist of 2022 and beyond.
2. Put the predictor training skills and theoretical knowledge learnt at University to test on a real world scenario.
3. Investigate how different choices made during predictor training (including some new innovative variations to traditional models) would affect performance statistically and empirically, so to aid future study and projects.
4. The Australian sports-betting industry is lucrative and the statistical/data science aspects of it is exciting; it is hoped a successful outcome could open the door to this industry for the author

The project was successful, and the resulting predictors can be found in M1.ipynb, M2.ipynb and
M3.ipynb and the
